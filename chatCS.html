                <img src="img/chatapp-messages.jpeg" class="study-photo5">
                <p> ChitChat was developed using React Native, Expo and GiftedChat to create a messaging application.
                    The
                    app provides users with a chat interface with options to share images and their location. Users can
                    choose between four different background colors for their chat which helps the app feel more
                    personalized. This app was styled according to the given screen design. The users' conversations are
                    stored in Google Firestore Database and the users can retrieve their messages without internet
                    connection.

                <h2 class="headlines">Purpose</h2>
                <p>This application was a part of my web development course at CareerFoundry to showcase my skills in
                    creating Native applications.
                </p>
                <h2 class="headlines">Objective</h2>
                <p>In this project, I aimed to build a chat app for mobile devices using React Native. The app will
                    provide users with a chat interface and options to share images and their location. </p>
                <h2 class="headlines">Project Duration</h2>
                <p>One month</p>
                <h2 class="headlines">Tools Used</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>React Native</li>
                    <li>Expo</li>
                    <li>Google Firestore Database</li>
                    <li>Gifted Chat Library</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="middle">
                    <h2 class="headlines">Process</h2>
                    <img src="img/chatappspecs.png" class="study-photo6">
                    <p>The first step in the process of creating this application was to start with the layout and
                        styling, which is different from the previous approaches I have learned so far. I was given the
                        exact specifications for the design, including the desired photo for the background image. After
                        the layout was complete, I installed the Gifted Chat library instead of creating my own chat app
                        from scratch. In order to save the messages being sent, I utilized Firestore. I chose to
                        authenticate users annonymously so users can begin using the app immediately without needing to
                        sign in. With the aim of being able to use ChitChat offline, using asyncStorage to provide a
                        JavaScript API that will allow messages will be stored locally.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="headlines">Challenges</h2>
                    <p>A key feature that the project brief required is to allows users to send photos and share their
                        location. I had an issue with creating the ActionSheet which would create a list of options for
                        the user to choose from. I researched the issue and scheduled a call with my mentor to discuss
                        the issue. I learned that I needed to additionally install ActionSheet as a dependency, as well
                        as change my class component to a function component so that I could utilize hooks.</p>

                    <h2 class="headlines">Results</h2>
                    <p>Getting to dip my toes into the world of Native Applications was a rewarding experience and I
                        look forward to continuing to learn more.</p>
