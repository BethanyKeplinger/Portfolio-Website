                <img src="img/MeetAppEvents.png" class="study-photo">
                <p>Meet App is a serverless (AWS lambda), progressive web application (PWA) built with React using a
                    test-driven development technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API and OAuth2
                    authentication flow to fetch upcoming events. User's are able to filter events by city, show/hide
                    event details, specify the number of events they would like to see and use the app even when
                    offline. The app also provides data visualization with Recharts to showcase the data in different
                    chart.

                <h2 class="headlines">Purpose</h2>
                <p>I created this app as a part of my CareerFoundry web development course to demonstrate my skills and
                    knowledge
                    of serverless progressive web applications.</p>
                <h2 class="headlines">Objective</h2>
                <p>In this project, I aimed to build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a
                    test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google
                    Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.</p>
                <h2 class="headlines">Project Duration</h2>
                <p>One month</p>
                <h2 class="headlines">Tools Used</h2>

                    <h2 class="headlines">Process</h2>


                    <p>Since the goal of this app is use the TDD approach, I first wrote out
                        user stories and then translated them into multiple test scenarios. Leading with a testing
                        first, code later mindset has allowed me to understand the users needs first and have a clearer
                        idea of the code that should be implemented to reach that goal.</p>
                    <img src="img/meetapplist.png" class="study-photo5">
                    <p>After deciding which approach to take on this application, I then worked to create the app as a
                        serverles PWA. Based on the project brief I was given, after I learned about the several
                        different types of Cloud Services available it was clear that a FaaS such as AWS Lambda would be
                        the best service to use for this project. </p>
                    <p>The next step in this project was to implement the BDD approach to ensure that everyone involved
                        in the project can verify whether the final application matches the initial product
                        requirements.
                        To make this happen, I used Cucumber.js and my Gherkin-based scenarios to test my application.
                    </p>
                    <p>As stated in the objective of this project, the goal was for the app to be a PWA so that it may
                        be
                        used offline on computers and mobile devices alike. I used Lighthouse to analyze where Meep App
                        stands against the PWA crireria, updated the manifest.json document and registered a service
                        worker.

                    <h2 class="headlines">Challenges</h2>
                    <p>The challenges that I faced while working on this project have given me many tools to address
                        issues
                        that I experienced after working on this project. I had my first lesson in figuring out that the
                        versions
                        of dependencies can make or break your application. My tutor from my CareerFoundry bootcamp
                        taught me to
                        research the issue to see if other developers are having the same issue while also working
                        through the issues
                        with trial and error to discover which versions work well with each other.

                    <p> This project gave me the tools to be a well rounded full stack developer with a greater ability
                        to
                        work through debugging code.
