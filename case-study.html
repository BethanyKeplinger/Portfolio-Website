                <img src="img/case-study.png" class="study-photo">
                <p>myFlix is a web application that was developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
                    stack.
                    This movie app allows users to view 10 different movies from the myFlix API that are displayed on
                    the
                    home page. Once a user clicks on a movie they are given the opportunity to learn more about the
                    movies’
                    genre and director. Users can then create their own profiles that hold a list of their favorite
                    movies.
                    Users may also update their profile information including their username, password, email and
                    birthday.

                <h2 class="headlines">PURPOSE AND CONTEXT</h2>
                <p>myFlix was a project that I built as a part of my web development course at CareerFoundry to
                    demonstrate
                    my mastery of full-stack JavaScript Development.</p>
                <h2 class="headlines">OBJECTIVE</h2>
                <p>In this project, I aimed to create a database and a REST API that would later be implemented in my
                    client facing myFlix web application. </p>
                <h2 class="headlines">PROJECT DURATION</h2>
                <p>Three months</p>
                <h2 class="headlines">TOOLS USED</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js</li>
                    <li>React-Bootstrap and React-Redux</li>
                    <li>Axios</li>
                    <li>Parcel</li>
                </ul>

                    <h2 class="headlines">APPROACH AND PROCESS</h2>
                    <img src="img/postman.png" class="study-photo2">
                    <h4 class="headlines">CLIENT-SIDE</h4>
                    <p>This was the first step in my process to create an entire web app from scratch. When I began to
                        learn about API’s, it was clear that Representational State Transfer (REST) was the best pattern
                        of architecture to use because it employs HTTP by using endpoints to identify the resources on
                        the web server the client wants to access. To test all of my endpoints, I used Postman. </p>
                    <p>It was ultimately decided that using a NoSQL database like MongoDB would be the best option
                        because of the flexibility it offers. However, I chose to use the dependency Mongoose to ensure
                        more uniformity in the data. These two decisions allow the data to be altered in the future if
                        that was decided to be best for the app.</p>
                    <p>The final decision to be made involved authorization and authentication. In my course at
                        CareerFoundry, I was given information about several different methods for authentication. In
                        addition to choosing to use HTTP authentication, I learned that JWT (Token-Based) Authentication
                        was favorable because of its speed, security and less strain on the server side. </p>

                    <h4 class="headlines">SERVER-SIDE</h4>
                    <img src="img/Jurasic-park.png" class="study-photo3">
                    <p>After completing the database and API, I built the interface for the client-side view of this
                        app. myFlix is a single-page application that uses React and React-Redux to build several views
                        and uses Routing to navigate between the different views. Separating these views into different
                        files allowed me to keep my code readable and easier to maintain. This app utilizes Bootstrap
                        for creating the design interface. I enjoyed the creative license that we had in this project.
                        Getting to make the design decisions ended up being an extremely rewarding part of this project.

                    <h2 class="headlines">CHALLENGES</h2>
                    <p>Throughout this project, I faced many challenges. I struggled the most with debugging in React.
                        When using dev tools to inspect my code for errors, not getting a clear idea where the problem
                        lied made for many hours spent trying to discover the issues. WIth the help of my tutor and
                        mentor, I was given advice on how to debug in those tough situations. I ran into several other
                        minor challenges including issues with images working and navigating working with Bootstrap for
                        the first time. </p>

                    <h2 class="headlines">END RESULTS</h2>
                    <p>Overall I learned a great deal about the MERN stack and how to create a visually appealing web
                        application. I had the most difficulty with the client-side portion of this application but with
                        the great guidance from my tutor and mentor I ended up with an abundance of new knowledge. </p>
