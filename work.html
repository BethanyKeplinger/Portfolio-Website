            This is Pokedex App that I made that utilizes JavaScript, HTML and
            CSS. This is my first time working with JavaScript. The app
            retrieves information for the Pokemon from an API called PokeApi. Users
            are able to view a list of pokemon and are able to click to see more details
            about each pokemon.
            The dependencies are JQuery and Bootstrap and follows ESLint
            rules.

            Chat App was developed using React Native, Expo and GiftedChat to create a messaging application. The app
            provides users with a chat interface with options to share images and their location. Users can choose
            between four different background colors
            for their chat which helps the app feel more personalized. This app was styled according to the given screen
            design.
            The users' conversations are stored in

            In this project, I took my myFlix API and created a new myFlix app using
            Angular. Users will be able to register for an account, log in and see a list of 10 different
            movies. The movies displayed include a synopsis, a brief biograpghy of the director, and a brief definition
            of the movies genre.
            Users can then add movies to their Favorite List where they can view them all
            on their Profile Page. I was responsible for the frontend development of this project
            and used Angular Material to create the User Interface.
